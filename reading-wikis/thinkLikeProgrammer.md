## How to Think Like a Developer

### Being a developer is not knowing how to write a line of code. Thinking like a programmer requires you to be a problem solver, and being a problem solver. Of course you will have to figure out how to do it, but just jumping in and coding doesn't cut it.

### Problem solving is a skill, and usually one that is sought after by employers. Unless you have a plan, usually your process will look something like this

 
| Step 1                             | Step 2                      | Step 3                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Try a solution | If it doesn't work, try another | Repeat step 2 until someting works by chance |

### This is inefficent and will result in wasted time. In order to be successful in this we need a framework and we need to **practice** so we can become efficient with it. 

### Your framework to solve problems doesn't have to look exactly like this, however it is agreed this is a good base framework to start with. You will develop your own style but  the basic steps are usually the same.

| Step 1                             | Step 2                      | Step 3                      | Step 4                  |

|Understand Your Problem             | Plan Your Route         | Divide Your Steps  | Recognize When You Are Stuck |

#### Understand Your Problem
 * *Hard* problems are hard usualy because you can't wrap your head around it 
 * Know the problem you are trying to solve
 * Can you explain it to someone? 
 * Try to rubber duck, make a diagram, anything to help you figure out what you are trying to make happen

#### Plan Your Route
 * Trying to write without a plan is a sure way to get lost in your work, necesitating you burn down your solution and start again
 *  Write your plan in pseudocode
 * Utilize comments to their fullest to help you keep your plan in mind

#### Divide Your Steps
 * Trying to do everything once is like trying to carry everything in one trip: You could do it, but it will be difficult, likely to have you screw up, and why? It could be done with less in smaller portions
 * This is the cornerstone of problemsolving
    * Break it into sub-problems
    * Start with the simplest and solve each
    * Next connect the dots to make a full solution

#### Recognize When You Are Stuck

* Take a deep breath
* Take a few steps to look for a solution
* Debug
  * Go through your process step by step to find a defect.
* Reassess
  * Step back and look at another prespective
  * You may need to burn it to the ground
* Research
  * Google it: someone's probably asked the same question before
  * Ask someone: A coworker may have a different spin than you

### This is not just a tool to have, this is something that needs practice. Practice with puzzles, games, whatever you can.
